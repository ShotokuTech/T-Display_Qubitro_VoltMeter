Monitoring My 200w Solar Panel Kit with Qubitro IoT Portal
Monitoring Solar Panels Using Qubitro IoT Platform.
Picking up where I left off with these inexpensive solar panels, I want to see what I can actually do with them. I put four panels in a south facing window, using the suction cups that comes with them. I wire them in series and patch them into a solar charge controller that is part of the kit. I bring my TTGO T-Display Voltmeter into the mix. I mash up some code to connect the T-Display to the Qubitro IoT Platform. This allows me to monitor the output of the solar panels remotely. I found that I can finally charge that big solar charged power bank and a lot more, using the USB port on the solar charge controller.
